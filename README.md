## Vision
I **believe** in human creativity; I believe that joy, self-actualization, and excitement are amongst the most essential elements of the human experience.

I believe that the normal human state is creativity; I don't think you can make a person creative, but you can definitely stop a person from being creative.

Personally, I find joy, excitement, and creativity in my work by removing creativity stumbling blocks for other people.

In a corporate setting or in a start-up, access to reliable, clean data is time-consuming, manual labor-intensive, and terribly frustrating.

Today nearly all tasks require data, and for many people, getting and cleaning data, though not in their original job description, takes up most of their day.

Removing the data barrier will, for many people, eliminate the most frustrating part of their workday and free up time to create business value, experience a fast-moving, creative, and exciting work life.

I happen to be very skilled in data management. My primary focus is cloud data warehousing, or more precisely, setting up structures that empower developers and businesses to build and manage a data infrastructure.

Delivering clean data in a reliable and automated way is the mark I want to put on this world.
